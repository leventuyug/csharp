# Disclaimer: A Project from My Graduation Days 🎓

This project was developed back in 2018 as part of my university graduation requirements. It’s a Human Resources Management System, built using C#, and, honestly, it was more about getting my degree than creating a masterpiece.

⚠️ Warning:

    The code you’ll find here reflects my skills and knowledge as a student—not the polished expertise I have today.
    Expect unconventional solutions, overly simplistic logic, and possibly some "creative" workarounds. It’s all part of the journey.

🤝 Feel free to explore, laugh, or even improve it. Just remember: this project helped me graduate, and for that, it holds a special place in my heart!
